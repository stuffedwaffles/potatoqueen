#ok this has to be in java ik shush people

"""
ok so basically i wanna keep a constant potato count
so we start with a file stored with the number 486000 since thats my current total

algorithm/idea:
when/if: one_potato_picked_up_action_stuff_happens
potato_count_file.open
potato count +1
close file


possible features: 
shows count for each farm- maybe a start farm function which triggers a count and it adds every time
total count stored and shown on screen whether you tell it to count or not


/scoreboard objectives add GetPotato minecraft.picked_up:minecraft.potato
/tellraw @a[scores=(GetPotato=1..)] ("text":"picked up one potato")
